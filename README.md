I used the AirBnB JavaScript styleguide

I have demonstrated the rules of the styleguide in my program =>

1. using const for declaring all my variables
2. Using the literal syntax for array creation
3. using object destructuring when accessing my properties for example when validating my forms.
4. used arrow function notation
5. I put all imports above non-import statements
6. I didnt include js filename extensions
7. Used shortcuts for booleans and explicit comparisons for strings and numbers
8. Used braces for multiline blocks
9. Put else on the same line as my if blocks closing bracket
10. Used /*..*/ for  multiline comments
11. used // for single line comments
12. started all comments with a space to make it easy to read
13. Used whitespace and commas correctly
